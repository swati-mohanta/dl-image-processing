# DL Image Processing Basics

## Overview
This project demonstrates **basic image processing operations** using a sample bird image. It covers common techniques used in computer vision and deep learning preprocessing.

## Operations Included
1. Reading an image
2. Displaying an image
3. Saving an image
4. Converting BGR to grayscale
5. Switching between color spaces (BGR, RGB, HSV, etc.)
6. Splitting and merging image channels
7. Resizing images
8. Flipping images
9. Cropping images

## Dataset / Sample Image
- File: `bird.jpg`  
- Used to demonstrate all the image processing operations.
